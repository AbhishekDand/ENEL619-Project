# ENEL619-Project

This is my Source code for the course ENEL 619.1 AI and CyberSecurity in the CPS.

For the Course project I have developed LSTM based Intrusion Detection System for MQTTIDS 2020 Dataset.

I have two Jupyter Notebooks for Packet-Based data for Binary and Multiclass Classification.
